# mutual fund ETL pipeline

Contains scripts that extract data from table and other sources, aggregates, transforms and loads into another database

Install packages from requirements.txt beforehand

Make sure to copy file_service folder to a different location and run the host_file.py on a different virtual environment/interpreter than the one running main.py

Run input_table_data/table_insert.py to simulate a table from which we read entries

Run main.py only after sales.zip is hosted in the previous step
